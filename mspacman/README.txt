Description: a CSS page, a JavaScript file, and an html page use slicing and draw functions to create a rendering of the Ms. Pac-Man game board. On the board is one sprite of Ms. Pac-Man and one ghost. All aspects of the lab were implemented successfully. McCall Bliss and Jay Wright provided advice for using the draw function and displaying multiple images on the canvas. Three hours were spent on this lab.
