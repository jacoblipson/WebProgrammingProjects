Description: Makes an XMLHttpRequest and obtains a JSON string from a webpage using AJAX. Parses the string and creates a div for each job parsed from the string. Displays company, location, and position information. All aspects of the lab were implemented successfully. Jay Wright pointed me towards the appropriate methods of using AJAX. An hour was spent on this assignment.
