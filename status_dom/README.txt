Description: One webpage emulating a social media site. Added a "newsfeed" update system, displaying user input on the webpage, with the most recent entry first. JavaScript was used to write three functions. Two functions are used to retrieve the message and store it in local storage, as well as display the messages and timestamps persistently (with the most recent messages first). A third function is called to format the date information to be used by the first function. All aspects of this assignment were implemented correctly, and thirty minutes were spent on this assignment. Collaboration with Ming was necessary to correct a Git repository issue.
